# Introduction and Guidelines

Computer Vision is a sub-branch of Machine Learning.If you are willing to learn more about it follow the code snippets in the following order:

1.  Basics.py = This snippet is about reading an image as input and applying filters to it .the cv.waitkey(0) call waits for key 0 then executes next lines.

2.  Imgoperate.py = Image operations such as flip are needed many times, this file has code snippet for that.

3.  Imgjoin.py = Code snippet on how to join two images and present them as one.

4.  Shapegame.py = This snippet first presents all common shapes drwan then the game starts and many images of rectangles start popping up pres the esc key to stop.

5.  Sub_imgfinder.py = Code snippet for the case when user needs to find the ocuurence of one object in a huge image

6.  Gradient.py = the directional chnage in intensity and color is called gradient, by changing gradient one can get smoothened or more deepened images .

7.  Contour_detection.py = Code snippet to detect contour in circular objects and sharp objects.

8.  Horror.py = Try live horrorfilter on yourself usinf this snippet.

9.  Smallparticle.py = Using this snippet one can identify small objects at micro scale , the only condition is that some distance must be present between between particles, actively used in biological studies, Uses Connected components method.

10. DenseOptical.py = The snippet accepts file as input and presents a multicolored output where once a human is detected multiple color variations move like them. This method is used in avation and defence industry.

11. Location.py = Finds the occurence of smaller image in larger one but more accurate and complex than Sub_img finder.

12. Face_detection.py = A basic model trained using harrcasscade classifer to identify human faces in an image, has an accuracy of around 93%.

13. Facial_features.py = Similar to previous snippet but this can identify eyes and smile in human faces trained using harrcasscade classifier.

14. QRcode.py = this snippet can be used to decode any hidden message behind a QR code.
